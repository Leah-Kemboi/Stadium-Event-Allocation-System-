Welcome to my Stadium Event Allocation System. 
The objectives of this project are to identify the problems in the current manual system, design a computerized system to address these issues, and provide a roadmap for successful implementation. The methodology employed involved a series of interviews, document examination, and analysis to identify the problems, followed by the design of a computerized system using Microsoft Visual Basic 8.0 programming language.
